# 使用java中的关键字作字典：避免混淆后与其他包重名，而且混淆之后的代码更加不利于阅读
#
# This obfuscation dictionary contains reserved Java keywords. They can't
# be used in Java source files, but they can be used in compiled class files.
# Note that this hardly improves the obfuscation. Decent decompilers can
# automatically replace reserved keywords, and the effect can fairly simply be
# undone by obfuscating again with simpler names.
# Usage:
#     java -jar proguard.jar ..... -obfuscationdictionary filename.txt
